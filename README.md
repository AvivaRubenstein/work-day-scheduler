# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

This site is a work-day scheduler.  It color codes each hour slot in the work day to represent whether the slot is a past, current, or future hour, and allows the user to enter and save tasks within any of the time slots.  These tasks are saved in local storage so that they repopulate on the page even after the page is exited or refreshed.
Through coding this project, I practiced using the dayjs API, as well as using local storage to save and repopulate saved content onto the page.

## Installation

Go to URL:  https://avivarubenstein.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Usage

To store an hourly task, click into the text area for one of the hour slots, type in a task for that hour, and click the save button on the right.  Now when you close the page or refresh you should still be able to see the content you saved in the correct slot.  Hours which have passed for today are colored gray, the current hour is colored red, and future hours are colored green.
